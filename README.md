# pbr-introsystem
Prismbeings intro system for building and developing primarily 4k demoscene intros. Forked from "i4k_OGLShader" (http://www.iquilezles.org/code/isystem1k4k/isystem1k4k.htm). The main difference is that this version is a LOT leaner and more streamlined (a few hundred bytes or so).

Note that this is just a very very skimpy empty canves that provides the bare necessities. It's enough to make excellent intros, but be prepared to implement a lot of common functionality yourself. Currently only tested with Visual Studio 2013. Further updates and transitioning to VS2015 coming very soon.

Ships with Crinkler 2.0, rename to link.exe and build in "Release" to compress.
